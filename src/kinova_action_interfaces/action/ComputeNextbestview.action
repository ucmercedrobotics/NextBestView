# Goal: Inputs provided by the client
geometry_msgs/Pose camera_pose           # Current camera position and orientation
octomap_msgs/Octomap voxel_map          # Voxel map (included for completeness, though not directly used)
geometry_msgs/Point[] frontier_voxels   # List of frontier voxel coordinates
geometry_msgs/Point[] occupied_voxels   # List of occupied voxel coordinates
geometry_msgs/Point bbx_unknown_min     # Minimum point of the bounding box
geometry_msgs/Point bbx_unknown_max     # Maximum point of the bounding box
geometry_msgs/Pose[] candidate_poses    # List of candidate poses to evaluate
